				 As a result, growing bonsai is both a traditional Japanese art and a very creative hobby.
				 <br> <br> 
				 There are various ways to propagate trees; some need a lot of patience while others yield results quickly. It takes at least five years until you have anything that resembles a tree when you grow a tree from seed, but you have complete control over the style of your Bonsai plant.
				 When you purchase a tree from a nursery, you can immediately style it.</br>

				<h3>How they have changed now</h3>
				<p> Pun-tsai was originally solely conducted by the society's upper classes using local specimens that were dispersed around China as expensive presents.
					 The practice of cultivating trees in containers was introduced to Japan during the Kamakura period, when much of China's cultural hallmarks were absorbed by Japan. Due to the influence of Zen Buddhism and the fact that Japan is just 4% the size of mainland China, the Japanese developed Bonsai in particular ways. Thus, the variety of landscape formations was much more constrained. Many well-known methods, fashions, and instruments were derived from Chinese models in Japan.
					 Although Bonsai has been somewhat popular outside of Asia for three centuries, this has just recently become the case.</p><br> <br>
